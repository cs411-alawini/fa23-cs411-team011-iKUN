## Project Summary

Our project aims to create a website containing several reminders and maps that show the trends and distributions of crimes in Los Angeles. Based on the database recording crime in 2020 and other auxiliary databases, we will build a data model that analyzes the safety conditions for each location and rate these safety conditions to give the users a reminder for their visits. 

Apart from the general reminders of location for all users, we will also use the database to analyze the safety conditions for specific groups of people. For example, we will count the victims for each location, so that we can give suggestions for specific groups like kids, elders, women, etc. Besides, the time that crimes occurred and the type of the crimes will also be considered to build reminder maps vary from 24 hours and the crime’s types. Eventually, our algorithm will generate a safer path in the map inputting the user’s age, gender, departure time, and destination.
